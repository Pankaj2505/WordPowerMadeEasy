<p>when the vowel sound is said very quickly. for example Listen to how the</p>
<ol>
  <li>-a of Linda;</li>
  <li>the -er of mother,·</li>
  <li>the a- of about,·</li>
  <li>the -er and -ent of different;</li>
  <li>and the -a of idea sound.</li>
</ol>

<p>Very quick-very short! The symbol “a,” called a schwa, represents the quick, short vowel sound in the five words above.</p>

<p>Now look back at the sentence preceded by an arrow.
The italicized words are rewritten as:</p>
<ol>
  <li>previous PREE’-vee-as</li>
  <li>sentence SEN’-ta’ns</li>
  <li>aloud a-LOWD’</li>
  <li>normal NAWR’-mal</li>
  <li>conversational kon’-var-SAY’-shan-al</li>
</ol>

<p>Note that there are two accent marks, one on kon’, another on
SAY’. Note also that kon’ is in lower-case letters, SAY’ in capitals.
Both syllables are stressed, but the one in capitals (SAY’) sounds
stronger (or louder) than the one in lower case (kon’).</p>

  <li>schwa - is quick sound</li>
  <li>’ is little stop</li>
  <li>capital word is stress</li>
  <li>S (ors) is always hissed, as fo see, some, such.</li>
  <li>After an -n, you will be tempted to buzz (or “voice”) the -s, because final -ns is usually pronounced -nz, as in wins, tons, owns.
