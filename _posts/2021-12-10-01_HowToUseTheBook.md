# Mater Schwa
when the vowel sound is said very quickly. for example Listen to how the 
1. -a of Linda;
2.  the -er of mother,·
3.  the a- of about,· 
4.  the -er and -ent of different; 
5.  and the -a of idea sound.

Very quick-very short! The symbol "a," called a schwa, represents the quick, short vowel sound in the five words above. 


Now look back at the sentence preceded by an arrow.
The italicized words are rewritten as:
1. previous PREE'-vee-as
2. sentence SEN'-ta'ns
3. aloud a-LOWD'
4. normal NAWR'-mal
5. conversational kon'-var-SAY'-shan-al 

Note that there are two accent marks, one on kon', another on
SAY'. Note also that kon' is in lower-case letters, SAY' in capitals.
Both syllables are stressed, but the one in capitals (SAY') sounds
stronger (or louder) than the one in lower case (kon'). 


# understand accent
1. schwa - is quick sound
2. ' is little stop
3. capital word is stress
4. S (ors) is always hissed, as fo see, some, such. 
5. After an -n, you will be tempted to buzz (or "voice") the -s, because final -ns is usually pronounced -nz, as in wins, tons, owns.
   - ambivalencet
   - affluence
   - opulence
   - sentence


     am-BIV'-a-lans  
     AF'-1®-ans  
     OP'-y~fons  
     SEN'-tans   
6. The symbol i or l is pronounced eye, to rhyme with high,sigh, my, etc., no matter where you find it. For example:
   - fights 
   - spy 
   - malign 
   - civilize 
7.  All consonants have their normal sounds.Except for G (or g), which is always pronounced as in give,girl, get, go.
    1. agree
    2. pagan
    3. again  

# Etymology (et'-a-MOL'-a-jee) 
Jn the etymological (et':i-m:i-LOJ'-:i-k:il) approach to vocabulary building:

> You will learn about prefixes, roots, and suffixeso You will be able to figure out unfamiliar words by recognizing
their structure, the building blocks. from which they are constructed-

```
Learn one root and you have the key that will unlock the meanings of up to ten or twenty words in which the root appears.
Learn ego and you can immediately get a handle on egocentric,
egomaniac, egoist, egotist, and alter ego. 
```
